## Operators

1. The values of `i` is 2, and the value of `j` is 1.

2. The following code prints `b`.

## References and Pointers

1. 10 10

2. 1764
    > in C++, there's no `**`

3. 0

4. 0
    > same as question 1, `i` is just a nick name of `j`

## Numbers

1. The differences are: `int` is always 4 bytes. In 64-bit systems, we need a longer integer, so `long` is 8 bytes, refers to the longest integer type in the system. However, the longest length in 32-bit system is 4 bytes, so `long` here is 4 bytes, which is a bit confusing. To solve this problem, we invent `long long` which is 8 bytes in both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Btw, `short` is 2 bytes.

2. The difference, simply, would be `float` is 8 bytes, and 'double' is 16 bytes. `i` here is 3.

3. The difference is that `unsigned` moves the negative part all the way to the right, which makes the integer a larger, non-negative number. The value of `c` is 0xff, 255 I guess.

4. The value of `i` is 0.
