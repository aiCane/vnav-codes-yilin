\section{Some words}

Lab 5 was a special experiment to me. I didn't have to do almost all stuffs on my own Ubuntu Desktop, because my teammate finally could do this on his arm based MacOS. Things became much easier to me like a month ago, and I finally had time to do my own stuff. However, everything is unimportant before ``however'', I found that I still couldn't handle my time confidently. There will always be endless stuffs, from nowhere, waiting for me to handle. That is to say, I was still busy and have no time to truelly relax.

Then, I relieved. Since I could never finish all these things, just leave them ahand. I need to relax, to have my own time. The deadline is tomorrow? That's fine, I still have a day and a half to do that. There's no need to be hurry. This is a lesson to me, a very important lesson.
