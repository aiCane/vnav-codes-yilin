\section{Some words}

This would be the last lab of this semaster. We didn't need to compliment any code, only a environment on computer is totally enough. This week is the deadline of three labs: 5, 6, and 9. We also have a signal lab report and a homework deadline this weekend, a presentation of academic English and a presentation of signal two days later, a lab report of computer network and a final exam three days later. It seems like always, things fill up in a few single days. Every months around, it happens over again and again. It somehow reminds me of: ``History is a good teacher. If you have not learn anything from him, he will teach you again and again, till you learn something.''

That's it. I need to do labs from other courses, now...
