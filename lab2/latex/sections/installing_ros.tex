\section{Installing ROS}

I followed the official documentation on \href{wiki.ros.org}{ROS.org} website.\cite{ROS-installation} It says better to set a mirror while in China, so I chose ustc mirror as I did before.\cite{ROS-mirror} Ustc also offers mirror for \texttt{rosdep init}, which is great!\cite{ROS-distributions-mirror}

Those bash code above are completely listed in appendix~\ref{sec:a_installing_ros}. I don't see the meaning of this, but it is what you want.
