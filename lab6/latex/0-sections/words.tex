\section{Some words}

A primary issue in Lab 6 was access to the outside Internet. There is a firewall around China, so normally, we cannot download anything from abroad. However, the lab materials were originally from MIT, a U.S. university, which meant it was difficult for us to proceed, and unfortunately it was. Teammates from other groups (who already seemed paranoid) gathered in WeChat groups to discuss how to gain access.

This lab was also unfriendly to low-RAM machines. My roommate has a \emph{16GB} memory laptop. Since it runs Windows, he must reserve sufficient memory for the system, around \emph{8GB}. Ironically, \emph{8GB} of memory for an Ubuntu virtual machine was far from enough.

Thanks to my teammate, he created many figures and wrote Python code for them. These figures helped make the lab report more professional. He really did a lot for the team.
