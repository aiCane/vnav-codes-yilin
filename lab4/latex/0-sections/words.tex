\section{Some words}

I laughed so hard... You know, that there was a speed-competition project in this lab, with extra credits for the top finishers. As usuall, ``those'' people went crazy tweaking parameters and adjusting settings. The funniest part was that someone ended up optimizing the solution down to just 7 seconds—and then kept the code within a small inner circle, trying to monopolize the top spots and sweep all the bonus points.

What’s even more ironic is that I looked up the public records of MIT students—their best times were still over 10 seconds. Somehow we ended up doing better than MIT... not sure whether to be proud or just laugh.

Come to think of it, writing lab reports always comes with little hiccups. Last time I tried Typst—clean syntax, but still too young, with lots of features missing, such as \textit{thanks} or even the most basic command \textit{appendix}. This time I’ve quietly switched back to \LaTeX. Tools are tools; what matters is getting the report done and submitted.
