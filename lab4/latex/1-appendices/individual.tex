\subsection{Deliverable - Single-segment trajectory optimization}

Consider the following minimum velocity ($r = 1$) single-segment trajectory optimization problem:

\begin{align}
\min_{P(t)} \int_0^1(P^{(1)}(t))^2 dt, \label{eq:obj} \\
s.t. \quad P(0) = 0, \label{eq:bc0} \\
P(1) = 1,
\end{align}

with $P(t) \in \mathbb{R}[t]$, i.e., $P(t)$ is a polynomial function in $t$ with real coefficients:

\begin{align}
P(t) = p_N t^N + p_{N-1} t^{N-1} + \dots + p_1 t + p_0.
\end{align}

Note that because of constraint (\ref{eq:bc0}), we have $P(0) = p_0 = 0$, and we can parametrize $P(t)$ without a scalar part $P_0$.

\textit{1} Suppose we restrict $P(t) = p_1 t$ to be a polynomial of degree 1, what is the optimal solution of problem (\ref{eq:obj})? What is the value of the cost function at the optimal solution?

\textit{2} Suppose now we allow $P(t)$ to have degree 2, i.e., $P(t) = p_2 t^2 + p_1 t$.
